<!--My vision-->     <p> Hi everyone! I am <b>_Wallwalker</b> and today I start re-learning to code. Bit by bit (or one could say byte by byte) I wish to take over the web world. They see me rollin', they hatin'</p>

<!--04 may-->      <p> <em> 04 May 2019 </em> </p>
      <p> May the 4th be with you </p>
      <p> Today I learned to list 10 things I hate about you:
<!--Experiment 1-->   
    <div class="experiment1">  
      <ul> 
        <Li> I hate the way you talk to me, and the way you cut your hair. </li>
        <Li> I hate the way you drive my car </li>
      </ul>
      <p> .... </p> 
      <ul> <li> But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you.... Awww </li> </ul>
      </ul> 
    </div>
<!--Experiment 2-->   
    <div class="experiment2">
    <ul> 
        <Li> I hate the way you talk to me, and the way you cut your hair. </li>
        <Li> I hate the way you drive may car </li>
      <p> .... </p>
        <li> But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you.... Awww </li> 
      </ul>
    </div>
<!--You could experiment here like I did. 1.) I created 1 list and put a <p> between the <li> to see how it'd look. 2.) Next, I created 2 lists and created a separate <p> in their mid--> 
<p> May your attention to detail kick in while choosing the experiment you prefer. Personally, I like 2 for its placement of dots. </p>
    
<!--Learn Tables and Nesting-->    
    <p> Next up is Tables and Nesting. As I'd got the hang of lists, my wait on tables wasn't too long. The 4 things to note are table, tr, th and td. </p> 
   <P> Here's an apt example for this week. As I wait for next Monday to come, I ponder over who wins the Game of Thrones... 
<table>
  <tr> <th> My order? </th> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Targaryen <ol> <li> Jon </li> <li> Dany </li> </ol> </td> </tr>  
   <tr> <td> Stark (Independent Winterfell) <ol> <li> Sansa </li> <li> Jon </li></td> </tr>  
   <tr> <td> Greyjoy (Go back to where they came from) </td> </tr> 
   <tr> <td> Lannister (Go back to where they came from) </td> </tr>
     </table>
     
<!--Composition-->     <p>Another important concept to be learnt above is <b>Composition</b>. It's the art of combining simple things to create complex beauties. You can put table in list, list in table, table in table, list in list, you get the gist. It follows not only in HTML but also in C, Java, Python and any programming you do. Composition, remember the name. As we wrap this concept up, I wish to compose a haiku in memory of this week's episode:</P>
    <div class="haiku">
     <table> 
      <tr> <td> The long night has come. </td> </tr>
      <tr> <td> With Viserion I conquer. </td> </tr>       <tr> <td> Valyrian stab me. </td> </tr>
    </table>   
    </div>
    <p> Fin. </p>
        
   <div class="Webwoes">
<!--11 may--> <p> <em> 11 May 2019 </em> </p>
  <p> After several bouts (days,scratch that, a week) of procrastination, I opened my laptop today with the intent of learning to add some finishing touches to my web page. I azure you, I'll start easy by simply changing its back-ground color. </p>
  <!--29 Jan--> <p> <em> 29 Jan 2022 </em> </p>
  <p> After several years, 2 jobs later, CashFlo and now joining Polygon, I opened my laptop today with the intent of getting back to learning how to code. I managed 5 videos</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpPXw4zFa0uKKhaSz87IowJnOTzh9tiBk"> Data Structures - Rob Edwards</a>
  <!--09 Feb--> <p> <em> 09 Feb 2024 </em> </p>
  <p> After another 2 years, I attempted to pick coding again, this time from Patrick Collins. Deployed my 1st smart contract (Simple Storage on Sepolia) </p>

  <!--23 Apr--> <p> <em> 23 Apr 2024 </em> </p>
  <p> After 2.5 hours of getting frustrated trying to figure out Webflow and Wix for creating a simple website, I decided to try out Weebly. I'd seen a YC video by its founder. And voila! Guess I just needed better tools </p>

  <p> But, <b>_Wallwalker</b>, you say, it says error 404, it ain't working. To that, I say, gotcha! Since the Weebly days, little elves worked on it to give the world a present </p>

  <p> Guess who's been consistently learning, coding week on week for some weeks now?

        <Li> Cracked my own procrastination </li>
        <Li> Found Grokking Algorithms and Lisp </li>
