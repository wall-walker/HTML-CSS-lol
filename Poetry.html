    <h1>Mischief</h1>
      <p>As the night arrives, a door closes. To her left, a chest breathes deeply </p>
      <p>The little one wakes up from her false slumber</p>
      <p>Mischief shines in her eyes as she slips her dancing fingers under the pillow cover</p>
      <p>A lone street light shines through the window pane as she hears the favourite sounds of her world. A binding opening. The crinkle of paper</p>
      <p>Her eyes squint, her mind quiets</p>
      <p>Silence</p>
<br> </br>
    <h1>Perfect</h1>
      <p>Clock ticking to six, one ear listening at the door for the bell.
Another pair of eyes peering through the window. 
Will it be the top of the head that'll appear first or the face through the door?
Shushing sounds and hand gestures. 
Turning off the television. Cover with cloth to hide its warmth </p>
      <p>One little set of feet run back to arrange books. One little face puts on a smile. </p>
      <p>Who will walk in today? </p>
      <p>A smile? A frown? A mask? </p>
      <p>Do you feel the simmering rage? Or a lack of air? Maybe the shoulders are relaxed today</p> 
        <br> </br>
      <p>Open sesame.</p>
        <br> </br>
      <p>Why does my heart beat so? Why do my palms sweat? Which face do I put on today?</p>
        <br> </br>
      <p>I hope my performance is perfect</p>
