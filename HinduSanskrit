     <h3> Daily practices </h3>
        <blockquote> समुद्रवसने देवि पर्वतस्तनमण्डले । विष्णुपत्नि नमस्तुभ्यं पादस्पर्शं क्षमस्व मे ॥ </blockquote>
        <p> Sharing a morning gratitude practice taught by my grand-mom since we were kids. It's a couplet dedicated to Mother earth </p>
        <p> On one hand, it makes me appreciate the ocean and mountains and the power of it all expressed in the form of Gods. On the other hand it also teaches me to recognise how I use nature daily and ask for forgiveness for harming it. </p>
